# Classroom_Engagement_Tracker(SmartClass)
An AI-powered system that automates attendance tracking and student behavior monitoring in classrooms

# 📌 Overview
SmartClass is an AI-driven system designed to automate attendance tracking and monitor student behavior in classrooms. By leveraging facial recognition technology, it streamlines administrative tasks and enhances the overall educational experience.​RFID module is responsible for automated attendance tracking using RFID/NFC cards. Each student and teacher is assigned an NFC card, which is scanned at the classroom entrance using an ESP32-based RFID reader. The scanned data is then processed to mark attendance and initiate facial recognition-based behavioral analysis.

# 🌟 Key Features
- **NFC Card-Based Attendance:** Each student and teacher uses an NFC card for entry.
- **ESP32-Based RFID Reader:** Detects and verifies NFC card IDs at the entrance.
- **Automated Attendance Logging:** Data is sent to the database for real-time tracking.
- **Teacher-Based Session Activation:** Facial recognition starts only after the teacher's scan.
- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Utilizes facial recognition to record student attendance in real-time.​
- **Behavior Monitoring:** Monitors and analyzes student behavior to identify patterns and provide insights.​
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on attendance and behavior for educators and administrators.​
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design ensures ease of use for both staff and students.​


# 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python with Flask framework  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Hardware:** ESP32 microcontroller for IoT integration  
- **AI/ML:** OpenCV for facial recognition

# 🔨 WorkFlow
- **Teacher Scan:** The teacher scans their NFC card to activate the session.

- **Student Scan:** Students scan their NFC cards at the entrance.

- **Data Processing:** The system verifies card IDs and logs attendance.

- **Facial Recognition Trigger:** After 2 minutes, facial recognition starts tracking students.

- **Database Update:** Attendance data is stored for report generation.
